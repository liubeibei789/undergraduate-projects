This project is to develop a multi-thread server, which can respond to several requests at the same time. 
The concrete method is to create threads by calling operating system API ( Application Programming Interface). 
The 3 users send message “Hi, God!” to the server respectively, and display the answer after receiving the response from the server. 
The system is tested with TCP and UDP protocol, with the user-defined port number.
