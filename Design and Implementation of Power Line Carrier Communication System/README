It is a tricky problem to measure electricity consumption in factories and plants. 
The difficulty lies in the high-intensive and complicated interference in the environment. 
Measuring through the common communication system will generate a great error. 
A power line carrier communication system is designed for the purpose of high-reliability data transmission,
under low signal to noise ratio (SNR) condition. 
Power-line communications system operate by adding a modulated carrier signal to the wiring system. 
Different types of power-line communication use different frequency bands. 
The system is based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), adopting the spread spectrum technology. 
The ultimate hardware implementation is a Plug-and-Play device applied to the wire plug.
