In the collection of images, there may exist some deviations between two images. 
If we find the lost points and false point to conduct the image matching, 
the pressure of procession and storage will be largely released.
The key problem for image matching is to figure out the transform regulation for the two images. 
This paper proposes a method of constructing congruent triangles in finding match points. 
The object is to include as many points as possible in accordance with this regulation, 
finding out most of the lost points and false points. 
Furthermore, concept “feature point set” is introduced to value the extent of matching. 
In the end, the algorithm is validated and assessed. Suggestions are proposed.
